# Code of Conduct

We aim to balance our goals of ensuring this space is safe while also not letting our group get bogged down in the endless minutiae of detailed rules. The more detailed a set of rules are, the more work is required to deal with people who try to argue their way around them. Why would we spend all our time doing that, instead of crafting? So rather than listing specific behaviours that are forbidden, thus requiring us to make even _more_ specific rules when edge cases arise, were going to take a different approach.

We will describe the kind of social space we wish to create and maintain. People who we feel are behaving in ways that are not conducive to this goal will be asked to change their behaviour. If necessary, they'll be asked to leave. The safety, comfort, and fairness of the group will always be our top priority. These guidelines are simply one tool to achieve that, not the end goal itself.

- Crafting is a fundamental human activity which everyone has a right to. We've been doing this for thousands of years across the whole world, so we're _all_ new to it. Gatekeeping is not only wrong, it just doesn't make any sense.
- We criticise products and techniques, not each other. Yarn snobbery is allowed, but without passing judgement on fellow crafters.
- There's a place for talking about sustainability but please have a sense of proportion, and keep in mind context of how our boarder economic system functions. Let's place the responsibility for environmental damage where it truly is.
- Everyone is welcome, and this welcomeness will be actively defended on your behalf if needed. You're not just allowed to enter, you're also allowed to be safe here.

## The Paradox of Tolerance

This space is cognizant of the [Paradox of Tolerance][tolerance]. Intolerance is not tolerated here. If you wish to debate this principle there are many forums and chat boards available elsewhere online for your perusal and enjoyment, but this is not the place.

## Groups of people who are welcome

Any and all marginalised groups. This includes but is not limited to people who are:
- disabled
- chronically ill
- racialised and minoritised
- trans, nonbinary, and gender non-conforming
- neurodivergent
- working class, welfare class, and impoverished

We can't list every kind of oppressed person here, but you get the idea. If you feel another group should be explicitly on this list, let us know.

### Men

The crafting community tends to skew towards white, cis, upper-middle class women. So although not classically thought of as a marginalised group, men can sometimes be made to feel unwelcome in crafting spaces. This can be especially true for men in other marginalised groups. All men are explicitly welcome here.

## Covid Denialism Will Not Be Tolerated

This includes stating or implying that the pandemic is over, and speaking about the pandemic in the past tense. These beliefs are currently socially dominant but are still obviously untrue, and are not up for debate. The panemic isn't over, it is just no longer being mitigated or tracked. The decisions you make in these global circumstances are your own to make, but denying they exist is not okay here. This group lives firmly in our shared reality and believes in the possibility and feasibility of an equitable collective outcome for this ongoing crisis.
