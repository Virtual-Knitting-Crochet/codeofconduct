# Code of Conduct

We aim to balance our goals of ensuring this space is safe while also not letting our group get bogged down in the endless minutae of detailed rules. The more detailed your rules are, the more work is required to argue against people who try to argue their way around them. So rather than giving specific behaviours that are forbidden, thus requiring us to make even _more_ specific rules when edge cases arise, were going to take a different aproach.

We will describe the kind of social space we wish to create and maintain. People who we feel are behaving in ways that are not conducive to this goal will be asked to change their behaviour. If necessary, they'll be asked to leave. The safety, comfort, and fairness of the group will always be our top priority. These guidelines are simply one tool to achieve that, not the end goal itself.

- Crafting is a fundamental human activity which everyone has a right to. We've been doing this for thousands of years across the whole world, so we're _all_ new to it. Gatekeeping is not only wrong, it just doesn't make any sense.
- Yarn snobbery is allowed, but without passing judgement on fellow crafters. We criticise products and techniques, not each other.
- Everyone is welcome, and this welcomeness will be actively defended on your behalf if needed. You're not just allowed to enter, you're also allowed to be safe here.

## The Paradox of Tolerance

This space is cognizant of the [Paradox of Tolerance][tolerance]. Intolerance is not tolerated here. If you wish to debate this principle there are many forums and chat boards available elsewhere online for your perusal and enjoyment, but this is not the place.

## Groups of people who are welcome

Any and all marginalised groups. This includes but is not limited to people who are:
- disabled
- chronically ill
- racialised or minoritised
- trans, nonbinary, and gender non-conforming
- working class, welfare class, or impoverished

We can't list every kind of oppressed person here, but you get the idea. If you feel another group should be explicitly on this list, let us know.

### Men

The crafting community tends to skew towards white, cis, upper-middle class women. So, although not classically thought of as a marginalised group, men can sometimes feel unwelcome in crafting spaces. This can hold true both for cis and for trans men. They are explicitly welcome here.

## Covid Denialism Will Not Be Tolerated

This includes stating or implying that the pandemic is over, and speaking about the pandemic in the past tense. These beliefs are currently socially dominant but are still obviously untrue, and are not up for debate here. The decisions you make in these circumstances are your own to make, but this group lives firmly in reality.
